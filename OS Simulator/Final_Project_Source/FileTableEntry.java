/* The file system maintains the file (structure) table shared among all user threads. When a user thread opens a file, it follows the sequence listed below:

The user thread allocates a new entry of the user file descriptor table in its TCB. This entry number itself becomes a file descriptor number. The entry maintains a reference to a file (structure) table entry.
The user thread then requests the file system to allocate a new entry of the system-maintained file (structure) table. This entry includes the seek pointer of this file, a reference to the inode corresponding to the file, the inode number, the count to maintain #threads sharing this file (structure) table, and the access mode. The seek pointer is set to the front or the tail of this file depending on the file access mode.
The file system locates the corresponding inode and records it in this file (structure) table entry.
The user thread finally registers a reference to this file (structure) table entry in its file descriptor table entry of the TCB. */
